      "On Sunday, April 27th, Madison Avenue was proudly painted in red, white, and green, as the historic Iranian flag—featuring the sun, lion, and traditional motif—led the way in a magnificent celebration of Persian culture and heritage.",
      "We were honored to welcome esteemed guests including Mayor Eric Adams, New York State Comptroller Mr. Thomas P. DiNapoli, Ms. Jessica Douglass, Director of African Affairs of New York State, and many other local and state officials who joined us for this special occasion.",
      "The parade commenced with the NYPD Mounted Horse Unit and the NYPD Color Guard, followed by a vibrant procession of music, dancers, and elaborately decorated floats that proudly showcased the richness of Iranian history and culture. The energy was electric as nearly one hundred thousand attendees—young and old—lined the streets, cheering, singing, and celebrating together.",
      "We are deeply grateful to our Board of Directors, Trustees, and the many dedicated volunteers whose tireless efforts made this festive event possible. Our heartfelt thanks also go to the generous individuals and organizations whose donations helped bring the parade to life.",
      "This event would not be possible without the unwavering support and commitment of the brave men and women of the NYPD. We thank them sincerely for ensuring the safety and success of the day.",
      "The celebration continued at Madison Square Park with live music, joyful dancing, and delicious Persian cuisine and sweets provided by three beloved Iranian food establishments.",
      "We extend special thanks to all City agencies—including the NYPD, Parks Department, Sanitation Department, and FDNY—for their invaluable support.",
      "We would also like to clarify that a few individuals displayed unapproved flags during the event. These flags were neither sanctioned by nor affiliated with the Persian Parade Foundation. While they appeared in public areas outside our control, including sidewalks and the park, we affirm that only the historical Iranian flag bearing the sun, lion, and traditional motif represents our organization. Any deviation from this is a violation of our policy.",
      "We invite all who value this cultural celebration to support the Persian Parade Foundation—whether through donations, membership, or volunteering. This magical event serves as a platform to educate the broader community, foster pride, and pass our cherished traditions to the next generation.",
      "Thank you to everyone for your continued support."
